# Docker
### Docker is a platform that runs containers.  
### Docker uses containerization to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized unit called a container.  
### The core of Docker is the Docker Engine, which is responsible for building, running, and managing containers.  
### Images are used to create containers, and they are stored in Docker registries like Docker Hub.  
### Docker containers are highly portable across different environments, ensuring consistency and reproducibility from development to production.
